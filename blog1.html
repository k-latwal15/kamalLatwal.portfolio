        Lorem Ipsum Post Generator is a simple plugin that generates posts and comments automatically. It’s also super
        easy to use, All you need to do is to just specify the number of posts and number of comments per post, rest of
        the job will be done by this plugin. One thing missing in this plugin is that it doesn’t have the ability to
        generate pages, categories, tags etc.
